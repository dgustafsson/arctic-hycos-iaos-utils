Arctic-HYCOS iAOS utils are a set of R tools for downloading, exploring, and extracting hydrological
data provided by the Arctic-HYCOS project (https://hydrohub.wmo.int/en/projects/Arctic-HYCOS).

Data are accessed from the web-services of the Global Runoff Data Centre (http://www.bafg.de/GRDC)
which serves as a data hub for the Arctic-HYCOS project.

Arctic-HYCOS iAOS utils are developed in the EU H2020 project INTAROS - Integrated Arctic
Observation Systems (www.intaros.eu) by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute.
